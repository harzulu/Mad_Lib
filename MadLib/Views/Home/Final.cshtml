    <h1>Twas The Night Before Christmas Poem</h1>
    <p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house</p>
    <p>Not a creature was stirring, not even a @Model.Animal;</p>
    <p>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,</p>
    <p>In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;</p>
    <p>The children were nestled all snug in their beds;</p>
    <p>While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;</p>
    <p>And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,</p>
    <p>Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,</p>
    <p>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,</p>
    <p>I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.</p>
    <p>Away to the window I flew like a flash,</p>
    <p>Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</p>
    <p>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,</p>
    <p>Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,</p>
    <p>When what to my wondering eyes did appear,</p>
    <p>But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,</p>
    <p>With a little old driver so lively and quick,</p>
    <p>I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.</p>
    <p>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,</p>
    <p>And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:</p>
    <p>"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!</p>
    <p>On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!</p>
    <p>To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!</p>
    <p>Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"</p>
    <p>As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,</p>
    <p>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;</p>
    <p>So up to the housetop the coursers they flew</p>
    <p>With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—</p>
    <p>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof</p>
    <p>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.</p>
    <p>As I drew in my head, and was turning around,</p>
    <p>Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</p>
    <p>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,</p>
    <p>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;</p>
    <p>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,</p>
    <p>And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.</p>
    <p>His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!</p>
    <p>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!</p>
    <p>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</p>
    <p>And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;</p>
    <p>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</p>
    <p>And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;</p>
    <p>He had a broad face and a little round belly</p>
    <p>That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.</p>
    <p>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,</p>
    <p>And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;</p>
    <p>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head</p>
    <p>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;</p>
    <p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,</p>
    <p>And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,</p>
    <p>And laying his finger aside of his nose,</p>
    <p>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;</p>
    <p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,</p>
    <p>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.</p>
    <p>But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—</p>
    <p>“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”</p>
